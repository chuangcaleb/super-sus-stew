# Super Suspicious Stew

> Makes Suspicious Stew from a brown Mooshroom more powerful!

When was the last time you ever used Suspicious Stew? Do you even know what it does?

Did you know you get can get Suspicious Stew by feeding a brown Mooshroom a flower, and then using a bowl on it?

## Motivation

Potions are powerful items, and they are rightly expensive and tedious to make, and take up a whole inventory slot. They are also not worth the trouble for most casual players who don't need 3:00 of a particular potion effect.

And then on the other hand, we have [Suspicious Stew](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Suspicious_Stew). Found in so many places, but their super short durations make them USELESS! One very unique feature in particular was how you can farm Suspicious Stews from very rare brown Mushrooms. But no one ever has a reason to do this, even though there's so much gameplay content that potentially can come with it.

## Design

With this datapack, if you right click a brown Mooshroom with a flower, and then use a Bowl on it, it will give you one Super Suspicious Stew, that grants a status effect according to the flower that you fed it with. This status effect is changed from the vanilla status effect.

All other sources of Suspicious Stew (crafting, trading, chest loot, shipwrecks) currently remain the same with the same vanilla status effects, but can certainly be extended to include this special Stew too.

### 1. Status Effects

1a. Tier progression: Players can have access to useful status effects before going into the Nether for Nether Warts or killing a Wither for beacon effects. Yet, the Super Suspicious Stew's effects are very limited in duration, so while 0:10 of Fire Resistance may be useful to keep on the hotbar to save their lives in a pinch, they will still need to do proper brewing to get 3:00+ status effects.

1b. Duration length is now long enough for it to be viable for players to actually practically use them. They can be used at any stage of the game, even in late game since as a weaker but cheaper alternative to potions! Effects like Blindness and Nausea are made longer so that players can use them in minigames or role-play or whatever they need!

1c. Accessible features: Interesting effects like Luck and Health Boost become accessible in the game.

1d. Quality of life features like Jump Boost and Dolphin's Grace, for cheap and short-duration use cases.

### 2. Brown Mooshrooms

Brown Mooshrooms are supposed to be this rare creature, but their one unique practical feature doesn't really do much. Red Mooshrooms aren't even that glorified, because nobody has a use for infinite Mushroom Stew; regular cows work just fine for their Steak and Leather.

Now, finding a Mooshroom Island actually means something. You could excessively breed red Mooshrooms or get a Chanelling Trident and wait for thundering weather. You'd have to transport the Mooshroom back to your base. There's so much content a player gets to invest in order to get a precious, prized brown Mooshroom for psuedo-potions.

### 3. Flowers

If players want Dolphin's Grace to conveniently cross a strait, a player must scavenge for the Lily of the Valley. To mass produce Super Suspicious Stews, flower farms have to be built in the right biome. Specifically, if PVPers want to mass produce the powerful Health Boost effect, they'll need to set up a Wither Rose farm! There's so many applications for the different effects of Super Suspicious Stews. There's so many goals to set, so much content that a player gets to experience and plan out for themselves. That's the core gameplay loop of Minecraft.

### 4. Endgame Content

As the latest addition, players can now get supercharged (soupier-charged?) versions of the Stew as an endgame challenge! They'd have to transport a brown Mooshroom *into the End* and soup them there to get the powerful Soupier Suspicious Stew, powerful versions with very interesting combination of potion effects. It's a lot of trouble to go through, but since once they've got the Mooshroom in the end, it's easy to spam farming the Soupier Stews â€” I've added an interesting 10-minute cooldown. The cooldown can be shortened with wheat!

## Limitations

The original vanilla Suspicious Stew is hardcoded to be given straight into your inventory and not bound to a Loot Table. There's probably a way to check for the original Stew and replace it, but I can't brain it, there's probably a better way that I don't know. So for now, players are restricted that **players must hold only one empty Bowl in their main hand to get Super Suspicious Stew from a flower-fed brown Mooshroom.** If players use their offhand, or if they use a slot with two or more Bowls, they will just get a regular Suspicious Stew and a feedback message in the action bar, telling them this limitation.

Please suggest how I can overcome this limitation!
